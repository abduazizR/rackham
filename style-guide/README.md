See the current [**Rackham formatting guidelines**](https://rackham.umich.edu/navigating-your-degree/formatting-guidelines/)
for the most up-to-date information.

This extension is based on [Derek Dalle's](@derek-ddalle) `thesis-umich.cls`,
which has been forked and modified by many others over the years.
The version at
[meluso/UMich_Dissertation_Template](https://github.com/meluso/UMich_Dissertation_Template)
is included as a submodule in this repo and is used directly by this extension.

Parts of the boilerplate template text in this repo are from
[umangv/thesis-umich](https://github.com/umangv/thesis-umich/).

# Example Appendix

TODO: get this to appear in TOC correctly

The command
\begin{verbatim}
\showlistofappendices
\end{verbatim}
must appear in the preamble if there are more than one appendices.  For
some reason, Rackham does not want the individual appendices and their
sections to appear in the Table of Contents, so a special List of
Appendices page (which must occur in the Table of Contents!) is required
as a sort of extension to the Table of Contents.

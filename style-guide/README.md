This is a LaTeX template that tries (but does not guarantee) to meet the requirements of the Rackham Graduate School at the University of Michigan.

I got this copy of the template from [Derek Dalle's webpage](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dalle/codes/thesis-umich/) and have modified it to remove various functionalities that can be found in standard LaTeX packages and added in code to address changes in the guidelines that Rackham posts.

Please make sure, of course, that you read Rackham's Handbook and formatting guidelines because they may change (or may become more strict about certain rules) over time.
